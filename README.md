### Hey, I'm Austin! 

I am looking to contribute to innovation in the tech world in any way I can!

I am currently working on the app below. It is in early stages of devleopment but its an app centered around golf.

The user can add clubs to their bag with distances they are comfortable hitting that club. Then on the home page while the user is golfing, the user inputs how far they are from the hole and the app will give the user a golf club recommendation.
